            <h2>Layout &amp; typography</h2>
            <p>The W3C needs to make sure that the text layout and typographic needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as people expect around the world.</p>
            <p>To that end we have experts in various parts of the world documenting layout and typographic requirements, and gaps between what is needed and what is currently supported in browsers and ebook readers.</p>

            <p>For an overview of the current framework we use for gathering requirements and analysing gaps, see Analysing support for text layout on the Web.</p>

            <p>To support local relevance of Web pages and eBook formats we need more local experts to participate in gathering information in these task forces, to review the task force outputs, and to lobby or support via coding the implementation of features in browsers and ereaders. If you are one of these people, or know some, please get in touch!</p>

            <h2>Language matrix</h2>
            <p>The page Internationalization support on the Web has an early draft of a matrix that aims to show where people around the world have problems when using their native language and writing system.</p>

            <p>Links from the matrix lead to more detailed gap analysis information for that language. The W3C is actively looking for participants and sponsors to flesh out the details of the matrix, so that it can identify pain points and take steps to address those in specifications and browsers.</p>

            <h2>Typography index</h2>
            <p>The page International text layout and typography index points browser implementers and specification developers to information about how to support typographic features of scripts or writing systems from around the world, and also points to relevant information in specifications, to tests, and to useful articles and papers. It is not exhaustive, and will be added to constantly. In addition, it points to other articles and documents that can help understand how typography and layout works in non-Latin scripts.</p>

            <p>There is also a Type samples repository that contains samples of typographic features which can be used for reference or for examples.</p>
